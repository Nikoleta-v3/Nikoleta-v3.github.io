provide services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.
Project Jupyter is most known for their Jupyter Notebooks but develops and supports
several computing products, such as  JupyterHub and JupyterLab.</p>

		<p><p><a href="http://soapboxscience.org/">Soapbox Science</a> 2018 took place in Cardiff on the
\(2^{nd}\) of June. The aim of the event is to promote STEM subjects
and more specifically the role of women by getting them to stand on a soapbox
and talk about their latest discoveries! This year the event was located outside
Cardiff Central Library and was once again a very successful outreach event.</p>

		<h3><a href="/2018/06/resultant-theory.html">Resultants in SymPy</a></h3>
		<p><p>I have recently been doing some work related to systems of polynomial equations. This work
has lead me to study several academics papers on <strong>resultant theory</strong>. In this blog
post I aim to give an introduction to resultant theory and a demonstration of
how we can use the Python package <a href="http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a>
to calculate the resultant of systems. I will end the blog post by describing the
particular contribution I’ve recently made to <a href="http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">SymPy</a>.</p>

		<p><p><a href="http://soapboxscience.org/">Soapbox Science</a> is an interactive public outreach
activity that aims to promote science to a public audience. More specifically, the
spotlight is on the role of women in STEM sciences aiming to promote their role
in these fields and reducing the gap between gender  inequalities.</p>

		<h3><a href="/2018/01/choose-reviewers.html">Choosing reviewers.</a></h3>
		<p><p>I recently came across the joy of submitting an article to a journal for publication.
I soon came to the conclusion that the process of submission is both exciting and
stressful. Exciting because you realise that a piece of research is finally done
but also stressful because you have to go through a check list and make sure
your paper fits the journal’s guidelines.</p>

social interactions. The prisoner’s dilemma is a two player non cooperative game

		<h3><a href="/2017/12/devaluation-of-rhino-horn.html">An Evolutionary Game Theoretic Model of Rhino Horn Devaluation.</a></h3>
		<p><p>Τhe name rhinoceros means `nose horn’ which is often shortened to rhino. The name
comes from the Greek words rhino (nose) and ceros (horn). There are five species
and 11 subspecies of rhino; some have two horns, while others have one
(<a href="https://www.savetherhino.org/rhino_info/for_kids/everything_rhino">source</a>).</p>

dilemma</a> (this is not a complaint) and I still get amazed by the
amount of information, insights and fun facts that I stumble upon;

Researchers have struggled for years to understand the conditions under
which cooperation can emerge. The applications of such research can be
found in industry, in society and in nature. As an applied mathematician
the tool used in my research is a game called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">
prisoner’s dilemma </a>. It’s origins go back to the 1950’s and it has
been an ongoing research topic until today.
