I am an applied mathematician and research software developer, currently
employed as a postdoc in the research group <a
href="http://web.evolbio.mpg.de/social-behaviour/">Dynamics of Social
Behavior</a>.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
My research interests encompass the utilization of game theoretic modeling,
numerical simulations, and data analysis to gain insights into behavior within
social dilemmas and various scientific fields.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
In addition to my research, I actively contribute to open-source projects. I am
a fellow of the <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk">Software
Sustainability Institute</a> and serve as a
topic editor for the <a href="https://joss.theoj.org">
Journal of Open Source Software</a>.
