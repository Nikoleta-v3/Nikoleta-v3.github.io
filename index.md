I am an applied mathematician and a research software developer. I am currently
working as a postdoc at the research group <a

Behavior</a>.

My research interests include using game theoretic modelling, numerical
simulations and data analysis to gain insights into behaviors within social
dilemmas and scientific fields.

I make contributions to open-source projects.
