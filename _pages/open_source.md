I contribute to open-source projects.

- `repeated-play`:.

- `Axelrod`:
[https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod](https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod).
an open source framework decided to the study of the Iterated Prisoner’s
Dilemma.

- `orthomap`:
  [https://github.com/Nikoleta-v3/orthomap](https://github.com/Nikoleta-v3/orthomap).
  A Python package to extract orthologous maps (in other words the evolutionary
  age of a given orthologous group) from OrthoFinder results. Orthomap results
  (gene ages per orthogroup) can be further used to calculate weigthed
  expression data from scRNA sequencing objects.

- `Arcas`:
[https://github.com/ArcasProject/Arcas](https://github.com/ArcasProject/Arcas).
An open source package designed to help users collect academic articles’
meta-data from various prominent journals and pre print serves.


I also have had contributions to other open source packages including `sympy`,
the Python library for symbolic mathematics (read blog post:[http://127.0.0.1:4000/resultant-theory/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/resultant-theory/)).
