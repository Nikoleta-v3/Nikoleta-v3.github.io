title: About Me
---

<!-- <h4>Greetings</h4>
I am a postgraduate research student at the school of Mathematics,
Cardiff University, an active fellow of the <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/">
Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)</a> and part of the <a href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/phoenix-project">
Phoenix Project</a>, Cardiff University. -->

I am a game theorist, a research software developer and a postdoctoral researcher
in game theory with a number of publications and a record of securing research
funding. I have experience in science communication, this includes delivering
invited keynote talks at computer software conferences.

  <li>Game Theory: The iterated prisoner's dilemma, training of strategies,
evolutionary dynamics, and emergence of behaviour. </li> 
 <li>Software development: Developing research software and contributing to open
source projects. </li>
</ul>
