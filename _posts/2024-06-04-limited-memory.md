Direct reciprocity facilitates cooperation in repeated social interactions.
Traditional models suggest that individuals learn to adopt conditionally
cooperative strategies if they have multiple encounters with their partner.
However, most existing models make rather strong assumptions about how
individuals decide to keep or change their strategies. They assume individuals
make these decisions based on a strategy’s average performance. This in turn
suggests that individuals would remember their exact payoffs against everyone
else.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
In our recent publication with Dr Alex McAvoy (the School of Data Science and
Society, and the Department of Mathematics at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel) and Dr Christian Hilbe (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary
Biology) we examine the effects of realistic memory constraints. We find that
cooperation can evolve even with minimal memory capacities.

Direct reciprocity is based on repeated interactions between two individuals.
This concept, often described as “you scratch my back, I’ll scratch yours”, has
proven to be a pivotal mechanism in maintaining cooperation within groups or
societies. While models of direct reciprocity have deepened our understanding of
cooperation, they frequently make strong assumptions about individuals’ memory
and decision-making processes. For example, when strategies are updated through
social learning, it is commonly assumed that individuals compare their average
payoffs. This would require them to compute (or remember) their payoffs against
everyone else in the population. To understand how more realistic constraints
influence direct reciprocity, the current study considers the evolution of
conditional behaviors when individuals learn based on more recent experiences.

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
<b>Two extreme scenarios.</b> This study first compares the classical modeling
approach with another extreme approach. In the classical approach, individuals
update their strategies based on their expected payoffs, considering every
single interaction with each member of the population (perfect memory).
Conversely, the opposite extreme is considering only the very last interaction
(limited memory). Comparing these two scenarios shows that individuals with
limited payoff memory tend to adopt less generous strategies. They are less
forgiving when someone defects against them. Yet, moderate levels of cooperation
can still evolve.

  <figcaption>A simple illustration of the model. At the imitation phase Blue (A)
  decides whether to imitate Red (B). Blue makes this decision based on their
  previous experiences. The existing literature assumes a setting of perfect memory,
  wherein Blue considers every single of his/her interactions with each member of the population.
  Our study introduces the limited memory scenario, wherein Blue only takes into account
  his/her very last interaction.</figcaption>

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
<b>Intermediate cases.</b> We also consider intermediate cases, where
individuals consider their last two or three or four recent experiences. The
results show that cooperation rates quickly approach the levels observed under
perfect payoff memory.

Overall, our study contributes to a wider literature that explores which kinds
of cognitive capacities are required for reciprocal altruism to be feasible.
While more memory is always favorable, reciprocal cooperation can already be
sustained if individuals have a record of two or three past outcomes.
