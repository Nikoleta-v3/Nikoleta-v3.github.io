[Soapbox Science](http://soapboxscience.org/) is an interactive public outreach
activity that aims to promote science to a public audience. More specifically, the
spotlight is on the role of women in STEM sciences aiming to promote their role
in these fields and reducing the gap between gender  inequalities.

A list of passionate scientists are chosen every year to speak out about their
latest discoveries!  The event takes places in a public area and the format is
the one of the [London Hyde Park's Speaker's Corner](https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/hyde-park/things-to-see-and-do/speakers-corner)
and there is one single rule NO SLIDES.

Soapbox Science events take place all around the UK. Last year it was the second
consecutive Cardiff event, which took place on Saturday the 10 of June 2017. I
was lucky enough to be informed about the event from my department and signed up
to be a volunteer alongside another MATHS Phd student, [Martina Cracco](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/research-students/view/215430-Martina-Cracco).

A total of 12 speakers covered a vast range of scientific fields such as Chemistry,
Astronomy, Engineering, Medicine, Earth and Ocean Sciences. The main event lasted
from 1-4pm and the day finished off with an amazing meal with everyone involved.

This year, after a great discussion with my PhD supervisor
[Vincent Knight](http://vknight.org), I decided to apply to be one of the speakers
for the 2018 event. The main reason behind it, was that I believe that mathematics
is a very misunderstood discipline. It is often described as too abstract and
theoretical and people are not always aware of its applications to real world
problems.

Moreover, the discipline also suffers from gender inequality. For example, within
Cardiff University a very low number of women make it to postgraduate studies.

So I filled in my application and submitted it, and I am very happy to announce
that I am one of the 2018 speakers of [Soapbox Science Cardiff](http://soapboxscience.org/soapbox-science-2018-cardiff/).
The event will be taking place on the **2nd of June** at the **Alliance Statue area**,
near the central library.

So I would like to ask everyone that happens to be in Cardiff on the 2nd of June
to walk by and listen to, not just me, but to all of the amazing speakers that
will be there.  That would be greatly beneficial to the cause of Soapbox science!

Moreover to everyone, (of any gender), that happens to be in Cardiff and wants to
be involved in a science event, you can fill a volunteering application
(as Martina and I did last year), which can be found on the [event's website](http://soapboxscience.org/soapbox-science-2018-cardiff/).

I hope to see many of you there, hopefully the weather will be good and I am pretty
sure I will not fall from my box!
