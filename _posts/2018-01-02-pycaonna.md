This is a joint blog post with [Geraint Palmer](http://www.geraintianpalmer.org.uk/)
about our experiences of PyCon Namibia ([PyConNA](https://na.pycon.org/en/)) 2018,
which was was the \\(4^{th}\\) consecutive Python conference held in the country.
The conference took place in Windhoek, from the \\(20^{th}\\) to the \\(22^{nd}\\) of
February. Supported by [Cardiff University’s Phoenix Project](http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/phoenix-project),
we an another colleague from the School of Mathematics (all [SSI](https://www.software.ac.uk/)
fellows), [Vincent Knight](https://twitter.com/drvinceknight), travelled to this
beautiful country and attended one of the finest PyCon conferences we have attended.

PyConNA 2018 :

- was a grand success of the local organising committee;
- was the biggest Namibian Python conference to date;
- had the largest number of local speakers.

The international attendees came from a variety of different countries, including
Germany, Finland, Wales, England, Northern Ireland, Greece, Zimbabwe, Nigeria,
Ghana, South Africa, and America. The organising committee included three attendees
of the first Namibia Python conference, [Jessica Upani](https://twitter.com/JessicaUpani),
[Ngazetungue Muheue](https://twitter.com/muheuenga) and [Ngatatue Mate](https://twitter.com/ngatatuemate),
University of Namibia lecturers [Gabriel Nhinda](https://twitter.com/Shingapi),
[Annastasia Shipepe](https://twitter.com/Stancia_Shipepe), and high school student
Queen Namene.

The conference was a great mixture of talks and workshops with each day concluding
with lightning talks.

**The workshops.** The first day was hosted a number of workshops, including the
very successful all day [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) workshop.
Further workshops that took place include, _**“Python for total beginners”**_ led
by Vernon Swanepoel, _**“An introduction to Data Analysis with Jupyter”**_ led by
[Tendai Marengereke](https://twitter.com/marengz), and _**“Introduction to TDD
with Django”**_ led by [Harry Percival](https://twitter.com/hjwp). Also 13 year
old Berhane Wheeler ran a remarkable workshop on building a guessing game in
Python and Daniele Procida led a workshop on how to organise a conference.

**The keynotes.** Two keynote talks were delivered by friends of the Namibian community
[Aisha Bello](https://twitter.com/AishaXBello) and [Marlene Mhangami](https://twitter.com/marlene_zw).
Aisha from Nigeria is an organiser of PyLadies and coach of Django Girls.
Aisha spoke about the community in Nigeria and the  inspiration she received from
attending PyCoNA which encouraged her to organise [PyCon Nigeria](https://twitter.com/pyconnigeria?lang=en).
The second keynote was presented by Marlene. Marlene is from Zimbabwe, is a director
of the PSF and co founder of [ZimboPY](https://www.zimbopy.com/). She spoke about
the growth of Python in African countries, from the first PyCon in South Africa
to the present day with a total of 5 different PyCons taking place on the continent
and many more local meetups and events.

**The talks.** A great number of interesting talks were given this year. These
included a talk by Queen Namena on the creation and achievements of a school
group called PyNam Scholars. Godwin Nekongo talked about [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news)
and how it allowed him to create a block dodging game. Even seasoned gamers would
find this game tough to beat! Hasan Masood spoke about visualising data using
[gmplot](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmplot/1.0.5) on google maps. Gareth Lloyd
told the story of [Jon Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow) (not from
Game of Thrones) and the usefulness of [GeoDjango](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/contrib/gis/),
[GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) and spatial plotting in Python. Vincent Knight
spoke about four different learning scenarios with different aims and the structures
he uses to teach programming at Cardiff University.

Several other great talks were delivered, the program of the conference can be
found [here](https://na.pycon.org/en/programme/).

**Our involvement.**

**Nikoleta:** For the first day I was involved in the Django Girls workshop where
we ran a very successful workshop with over 20 attendants of different ages
accompanied by six coaches. Coaching at Django Girl Windhoek is a lovely experience
that I always look forward to. Similarly this year, I had the opportunity to teach
a number of young and passionate women. Additionally, I delivered a talk on using
Python and mathematics to study the behaviour of rhino poachers, a work that is
done mainly using one of my favourite libraries, SymPy. A pre print of this work
is available on arXiv: [arXiv:1712.07640](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07640).
Finally, I have written a [blog post](https://nikoleta-v3.github.io/blog/2017/12/22/devaluation-of-rhino-horn.html)
that summarises the talk.

This was my second PyConNA conference and I am hoping that it will not be the last
one. It truly was a great event and I would highly recommend anyone to get involved,
either by giving  talks, coaching django girls, or even running your own workshop.
PyCon offers a great opportunity to interact with the African programming community.
Be prepared to be amazed by the motivation and the hard work that is going on and
to enjoy a few days under  the sun.


**Geraint:** Along with Vincent Knight we ran a workshop on using [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)
for symbolic mathematics, entitled _**“Python and Python and Maths, Oh My”**_
(yes seriously). This was good fun, with SymPy enabling us to comfortably introduce
some advanced mathematical concepts to non-mathematicians in a relaxed setting.
A personal highlight for me was overhearing a group of high schoolers enthusiastically
discuss differentiation and optimisation using SymPy at a coffee break.

I also gave a talk on [Agent Based Modelling with Python](http://www.geraintianpalmer.org.uk/talks/AgentBasedModelling/index.html#/),
expanding on a [blog post](http://www.geraintianpalmer.org.uk/2017/08/19/schelling-segregation/)
where I recreated and experimented with a Python implementation of Schelling’s
segregation model. It was fun to show that a versatile tool such as Python can
help us gain insights into human behaviours.


This was my fourth time at a Namibian Python conference, having attended the first
back in 2015, and it has been a privilege not only to see the conference and community
grow each year, but also seeing the growth of friends we had made four year ago.
When I first met Jessica she hadn't programmed before, now she is chair of PyConNA,
teaches programming in schools, and coaches teams of high schoolers to win national
programming competitions! Kandoza and Muheue both gave their first ever PyCon
talks this year, both presenting technical skills to solve African problems
(Kandoza's on interfacing Pandas and Excel, and Muheue's on connecting Raspberry
Pi's to computers).
