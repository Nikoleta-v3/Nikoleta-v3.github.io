[Soapbox Science](http://soapboxscience.org/) 2018 took place in Cardiff on the
\\(2^{nd}\\) of June. The aim of the event is to promote STEM subjects
and more specifically the role of women by getting them to stand on a soapbox
and talk about their latest discoveries! This year the event was located outside
Cardiff Central Library and was once again a very successful outreach event.

This year speakers covered a vast range of scientific fields such as Chemistry,
Biosciences, Engineering, Taxonomy, Earth Science and Mathematics. The list of speakers
can be found on the Soapbox Science Cardiff website:
(http://soapboxscience.org/soapbox-science-2018-cardiff/)[http://soapboxscience.org/soapbox-science-2018-cardiff/].

The success of every event is due it's volunteers and it's organising committee.
The event had a large number of volunteers, both males and females, from PhD students,
to Postdocs and researchers at universities and in industry. The volunteers had a
full day schedule with various tasks throughout the day, including being Dylan the
Welsh Dragon, collecting feedback, counting footfall and inviting passer by.

A huge thank you to the organisers Helen Obee Reardon, John McCrory, Hayley Wyatt,
Dhobasheni Newman and Jennifer Pike. You can follow the event on twitter [@SS_Cardiff](https://twitter.com/SS_Cardiff).

Finally this year my department, the School of MATHS of Cardiff University, did not
fail to participate in the event. I myself have been one of this year's speakers
and my PhD supervisor [Vince Knight](https://twitter.com/drvinceknight) was my assistant.
A total of five other PhD students volunteered for the day:
